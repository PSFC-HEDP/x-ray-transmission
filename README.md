# `x-ray-transmission`

This repository contains a notebook used to plot and fit transmission data taken from the [Proto XRD system](https://leia.psfc.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/PROTO-XRD). Instructions are included at the beginning of the notebook.

Note: To create MCA files from spectrometer readings you will need the appropriate [driver](https://www.amptek.com/software/dp5-digital-pulse-processor-software/dpp-installation-instructions) installed on your computer as well as the [DPPMCA software](https://www.amptek.com/software/dp5-digital-pulse-processor-software/dppmca-display-acquisition-software).
