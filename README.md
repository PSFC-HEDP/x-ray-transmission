# x-ray-transmission
Author: Niels Vanderloo with inspiration from a MATLAB script by Jacob Pearcy

This notebook is used to plot and fit transmission data taken from the [Proto XRD system](https://leia.psfc.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/PROTO-XRD
).
It requires two uncommon python packages
- `pip install mcareader`
- `pip install xraydb`

To create MCA files from spectrometer readings you will need the appropriate [driver](https://www.amptek.com/software/dp5-digital-pulse-processor-software/dpp-installation-instructions) installed on your laptop as well as the [DPPMCA software](https://www.amptek.com/software/dp5-digital-pulse-processor-software/dppmca-display-acquisition-software).
